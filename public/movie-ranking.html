<h1>The Best Movies According to Saurav</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>This film explores themes like humanity, 
    selfhood, compassion, and belonging. 
    It's known for its hand-drawn animation, which is considered a feat of animation in itself</p>
<h3>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</h3>
<p>This film is undeniably a fantasy. 
    But the feelings that Eternal Sunshine evokes couldn't feel more 
    grounded in the real devastation of a lost loveâ€”or the blissful fatedness of a new one..</p>
<h3>Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na</h3>
<p>Being a cult classic in Bollywood, this is a movie that can be seen several times without getting bored.
     This movie holds a very special place in my heart along with beautiful memories</p>
